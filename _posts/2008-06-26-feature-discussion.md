I am sure to develop a completely integrated version of a web development tutorial site. I am wanting to aggregate the features of a good website in the new one. I am primarily interestedÂ  in the way that w3schools have modeled their website really search engine friendly, but I also love the way problogger has their website completely well designed. I am interested to pick features from all websites possible and in the next three months try to integrate all the facility into the new platform so that it is well in place for me to start adding articles. This is a mega project and hence has no room for mistakes and bad work.
