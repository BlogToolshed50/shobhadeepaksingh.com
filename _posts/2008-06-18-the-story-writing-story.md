  I like coming up with nice stories at runtime. It is more like writing my mind as it thinks. I like doing this exercise since that really can free my mind of any thoughts. Cleaning mind of thoughts is the ultimate aim of yoga. I would not say at this point that this method is as good as yoga but I would definitely think hat this is somewhat in lines with that<span> </span>or rather a totally different way that aims at the ultimate aim of having a blank mind. Well to think about it in<span> </span>a funny way, when you become mad too, you&#8217;ll have<span> </span>a blank mind. I don&#8217;t this this should take you to wrong conclusions but this is just an experiment that i am conducting. Hopefully it should be good enough so that I can publish my results here.
