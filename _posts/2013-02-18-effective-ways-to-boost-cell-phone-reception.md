According to a recent CNET article, there are 206 million cell phone users in the U.S. The majority of those users complain that coverage is sometimes sparse and reception is often frustrating. In fact, Consumer Reports&#8217; Annual Cell Phone Survey reported that 70% of survey respondents had at least one dropped call within a week&#8217;s time and 60% suffered from bad connections. Nonetheless, Americans are still in love with their cell phones.

So, what can you do when the love of your life lets you down? What help is there when your cellular reception is less than you need it to be? There are a variety of cell phone antennas and other cell phone accessories that can boost your cellular reception without breaking your budget.

Replacement Cell Phone Antennas

Something as simple and inexpensive as replacing your cell phone antenna can do wonders to increase your cellular reception. If your original cell phone antenna is not up to par, consider choosing a new antenna specifically designed for maximum reception in the areas in which you travel. You&#8217;ll want to keep in mind that not all cell phones are equipped with antennas that are replaceable by the user. Also, while antennas can improve reception, the signal strength of your cell phone provider is also a determining factor.

If you primarily find yourself on flat terrain, choose an antenna with a 3db to 9db range. For areas with lots of obstructions (hills, buildings, wooded areas) consider a cell phone antenna with a 0db to 3db range. If you encounter a variety of terrain, an antenna with a 3db to 5db range would work best. The cost? From $3 to $40 depending on design, brand and function. Besides cell phone antennas, there are also external antennas. This is not your only option, however. There are many cell phone accessories available that help increase cellular reception.

External Antennas

External antennas can mount to almost any surface. From the roofs of houses or office buildings to metal on cars to glass windows, external antennas can greatly increase your cellular reception within the given coverage area. At a cost from $20 to $100, external cell phone antennas can be very effective. Keep in mind, however, that these accessories only aid reception within a particular environment where the antenna is located. External antennas may require an antenna adapter cable to function properly.

Desktop Suction Antennas

Originally designed for travelers, desktop suction antennas help increase cellular reception practically anywhere. These cell phone accessories plug into a standard power outlet and then suction-mount to a desk or window. No wires are connected to your cell phone. These types of antennas are great for hotels, rural homes, office buildings or other environments. Because there is no permanent connection, desktop antennas are great for those who move from place to place. At a cost of about $30, desktop antennas are very affordable.

Cell Phone Amplifiers

If you&#8217;re looking for a serious, permanent solution to noisy connections or dropped calls, consider a cell phone amplifier. These cell phone accessories can connect in two ways: directly to your phone through the RF port (wired) or wireless. Let&#8217;s look at each one individually.

Wired Amplifiers

Amplifiers increase cellular reception and extend coverage for up to 50 miles. The amplifier itself is powered by either an electrical outlet or a car&#8217;s cigarette-lighter adapter. This is a wired connection, however. Wired amplifiers work well in vehicles or home/office environments where your cell phone can be plugged in, but would not help with cellular reception while you&#8217;re not connected to the amplifier. The cost? Between $200-$300.

Wireless Amplifiers

If you&#8217;d rather not have a hard connection, consider a wireless amplifier. Using a combination of external and internal cell phone antennas, wireless amplifiers allow multiple phones to work inside your vehicle, office or home without the need for a direct connection with each phone. Wireless amplifiers cost between $450-$700.

Depending on what solution you need, your level of mobility and the amount you intend to spend, there are multiple cell phone antennas and other cell phone accessories designed to boost your reception with great results.
