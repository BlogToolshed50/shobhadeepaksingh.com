When the countries are viewing with each other in poverty alleviation the problem of malnutrition still prevails . In fact in many African countries the population that is under nourished is on the increase, leave alone the question of malnutrition. Despite the fact that medical revolution has improved the life expectancy of the human being , malnutrition is certainly counteracting this development.It is high time that United Nation in coordination with various other organizations should come to the rescue of the starving populace to end this menace.Recent findings have confirmed that ,diversion of human food towards bio fuel is also one among the reason for the shortage of food for human consumption. In fact 40% of the corn produced in the world is diverted towards such bio-fuel production.
