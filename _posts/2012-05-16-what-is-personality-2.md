Personality is the sum total of the ways in which an individual reacts to and interacts with others. It is most often described in terms of measurable traits that a person exhibits.

Personality Determinants
  
An adult’s personality is generally considered to be made up both hereditary and environmental factors, moderated by situational conditions.

Heredity Heredity refers to those factors that were determined at conception. Physical stature, facial attractiveness gender, temperament, muscle composition, and reflexes, energy level, and biological rhythms are characteristics that are generally considered to be either completely or substantially influenced by who your parents were, that is, by their biological, physiological, and inherent psychological make up.

Tree different streams of research lend some credibility to the argument that heredity plays an important part in determining an individual personality. The first look at the genetic underpinning of human behavior and temperament among young children. The second address the study of twins who were separated at birth. The third examines the consistency in job satisfaction over time and across situation.

Environment Among the factors that exert pressures on our personality formation are the culture in which we are raised, our early conditioning, the norms among our family, friends, and social groups, and other influences that we experience. The environment which we are exposed plays substantial role in shaping our personality.

For example, culture establishes the norms, attitudes, and values that are passed along from the generation to the next and create consistencies over time.

Situation A third factor, the situation, influences the effects of heredity and environment on personality. An individual’s personality, although generally stable and consistent, does change in different situations.

It seems only logical to suppose that situations will influence an individual&#8217;s personality, but a neat classification scheme that would tell us the impact of various types of situations has so far eluded us. Apparently we are not yet close to the developing a system for clarifying situations so they might be systematically studied. How ever we do know that certain situations are more relevant than others in influencing personality.
