When you run a small home business, you need to take into account , things that can make you look professional. I would suggest you to have signed up for a 1800 toll free number redirected to your personal phone and have a wonderful PO box rented from the local postal office. Apart form this you really need to have a good quality rubber stamp on your letters and correspondences. It is really easy to get yourself a [custom rubber stamp](http://www.rubberstampchamp.com/) that will help you add a professional touch to your local home business. Try it and find the difference in the impression it makes on your customers.
