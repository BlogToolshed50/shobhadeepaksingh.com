When someone does something that they know that they shouldn&#8217;t do, did they really have a choice. Maybe what I mean to say is did they really have a chance. You can take two people, present them with the same fork in the road, and one is going to have an easier time than the other choosing the right path.

Is there such a thing as the right path? You could argue back and forth with God and Evolution and such topics. The side that you take in an argument like that might lead you to think that you know the meaning to life. How can we really know though. At least up until now there isn&#8217;t and 100% proof to either side. If God was a guarantee &#8211; why would he leave so many of us here to die, without the information or say it as proof that we individually would have needed to make that choice? If Evolution was a guarantee &#8211; why would there be two thousand years of person to person proof that Jesus walked on Earth? We&#8217;ve already seen a lot of weird things happen in our lifetime, and I think that we will see a lot more. Our world is too much of an unstable place, and as time grows on we just grow out further. Every Civilization has fallen. How long do you think we have? Look at America. We&#8217;re built on a pretty rough foundation. Events like the Hurricanes, have humbled us, and showed us how vulnerable we are to things we can&#8217;t avoid. Our entire economy is built on Oil, and we are feeling the effects of the instability in the Oil world. Will the next war be over oil. Was the last one?

The Persian Gulf has over half of the word&#8217;s oil sitting underneath it, but they can&#8217;t seem to get their act together above the surface. The United States is the largest consumer of Oil, and they only have 3% of the world&#8217;s oil reserves. How long can they go on, being so dependent on Oil, and borrowing as much as they do. Well into the Trillions, the US is the world&#8217;s largest debtor. That makes me wonder where all that money is coming from. The 30&#8242;s showed us what happens when the markets collapse.
