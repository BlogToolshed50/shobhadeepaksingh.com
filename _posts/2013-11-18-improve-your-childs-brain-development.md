Some parents are unaware of the fact that not all children develop with natural coordination and/or gross motor skills. Most parents seem to think that this part of child development is something that they will just figure out as they go. But coordination, in some children, needs to be taught and it can be as simple as doing a few exercises for 10 min play per day to see child development improvements.

Some parents also do not realize the importance of coordination in their children&#8217;s learning abilities. Cross coordination improves the function of &#8216;left brain/right brain&#8217; activity which promotes full use of the brains capabilities and which is a very important part of child development.

Have you noticed sometimes that your children find it really hard to learn different things eg reading, spelling, arithmetic etc yet sometimes when you teach them a certain way it appears easier eg visually, via audio or via touch. That is because children use their brains differently. Some may be more right brain orientated and others more left brain. But you can help improve child development and overall learning capabilities by improving their cross coordination and opening up the pathways to both sides of the brain.

The coordinated Kids child development program has been designed to not only improve your child&#8217;s coordination and gross motor skills, but also their learning abilities at the same time.

Once you have an understanding of the importance of coordination in child development you will know what to look out for and be able to implement the exercises to help improve your child&#8217;s coordination as they develop. If you are unsure of the current level of your child&#8217;s development or their coordination why not try the free Quick Test on the home page of our website to see how they are progressing with the exercises. If you feel that they might be finding them difficult then you can start the coordinated Kids child development program and start implementing the exercises to help them improve and get better.

You can start developing your child&#8217;s coordination as young as 6 myths with some cross patterning exercises on the floor &#8211; right through to encouraging and teaching them to crawl before they walk. (This is a very important part of child development and coordination development as it is a natural cross coordination movement that children take with them through to their next developmental stages including walking, running and climbing).

A lot of parents do not realize the importance of crawling in child development with some children missing this step altogether, going straight from sitting, to bum hopping, to standing and then walking, completely missing out on the important cross coordination exercise of crawling.

These children may learn cross coordination through other external activities but some continue to be parallel right through to puberty and beyond. (We did a test with our mothers group to see how many mothers were parallel and it was amazing how many thought they were coordinated when clearly they were not. By the way, parents can reprogram their brains at any time and learn with their children which not only improves their children&#8217;s coordination and learning but their own coordination and learning abilities as well).

What parents also do not realize is that these child development skills can be learnt, in a very short period of time, at any age, using the exercises set out in the coordinated kids child development program. The activities are simple, fun and something you can play together as a family for 10 min per day. Once you get it, you get it, but it helps to do the exercises on a regular basis to keep that right/brain left brain working at its maximum. Some teenagers and adults find doing these cross coordination activities helps them prior to exams and while they are studying.

I have been using this with child development program with my 3.5 year old son since he was 6mths. I taught him how to crawl as I new the importance of cross coordination in his overall child development. Quite a few of the children from my mothers group did not crawl, but went straight from sitting to the bum hop or straight to standing and then walking, missing the cross coordination of crawling completely. I have seen the difference in the child development of the children who did crawl and those who did not over the last 3.5 years and the mothers are amazed not only at my child&#8217;s motor skill abilities but at his learning abilities as well. I have no doubt in my mind that it has made a difference and that it will continue to make a difference throught out his developing years. Please read some of the success stories on our website about others who have seen vast improvements in their child&#8217;s development.

Your children deserve the best start in life, knowledge is power and child development is so important. We keep learning more and more every day about the power of the brain and how much children can absorb and learn from such a young age and coordination plays a very big part in child development.

Why leave it to chance, when you know that you have the opportunity to send your child to school with the confidence, skills and mindset to be and achieve whatever they want in life &#8211; I know that is what I want for my son.
