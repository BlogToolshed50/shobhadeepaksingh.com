These day&#8217;s internet has become really a huge media for music. There has been a gradually increasing population who are considering internet as a major media for entertainment. Seeing a movie and listening to music online is something that most of us like to do since ewe can be really choosy in our programs. Itunes and other major media players have built in radio facility that clearly states how important online music and media is. With the increase in this trend new online radio companies are also budding by the day. If you are a die hard old rock fan then you must be knowing about XFM has been going since 1997 which is one of the best old rock music channels. I used to listen to this channel earlier, but recently the charm of listening to the radio has gone down sine we spend most of our time on the internet.

This comes as a great news that XFM has shifted its spectrum to internet radio too. This provides me with the facility to listen to those of my favorite programs online too. music news is another great feature of this website that is also impressing me. I think I am going to continue listening to this channel since it is not internet friendly.
