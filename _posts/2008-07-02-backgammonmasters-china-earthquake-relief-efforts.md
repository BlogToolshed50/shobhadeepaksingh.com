BackgammonMasters has been a great gaming website for poker, backgammon and Blackjack. Long back there has been numerous news about this huge company about a huge dice that they were rolling . This was a sensational news as the dice was too huge and they actually used a helicopter to roll the dice. Recently the Backgammon Masters have announced in a press release that they are going to transact a Million Dollars to aid the people affected by the floods in china. backgammonMasters company has offered to match $5 for every $1 donated from a months worth of tournament buy-ins ranging from $4.50 to $200. Many players will participate online in playing backgammon on their website and all the prize money will go to the UNICEF organization. For those who are not aware, UNICEF is a child welfare organization that is currently focussed on helping the children affected due to the floods in China.

This is a very generous act of the Backgammon Masters company.The main reason why the company wants to help china is due to the fact that a Chinese dice game named Perudo is a part of their website games. Also there is a huge Asian traffic to the website. Thus they believe that they can draw the attention of people towards this crisis so that they could help. backgammon Masters&#8217;s CEO has said that they feel that it is important to encourage charitable gaming and to make this type of community outreach in the online casino world a common occurrence. This is highly appreciable and I would recommend all my blog readers to take part in this season of charitable gaming at Backgammon Master&#8217;s website.
