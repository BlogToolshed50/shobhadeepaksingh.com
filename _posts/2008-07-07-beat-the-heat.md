Building style in construction can also become a major player in the way we can beat the heat. The method to beat the heat is called deck insulation. In this system there is a thermal barrier that is provided on the roof of the room below the RCC. RCC is the concrete roof that is thick and very conductive to heat. The simple concept for the technique to beat the heat is to place this insulation over the RCC so that the sun does not even fall on the RCC and provide it a chance to get heated. Thus changing our current practices to put the insulation layer below the RCC we can put it above the RCC to protect us form the heat.
