What is Success to You?
  
The definition of success we seek to live and breath is as varied as we are unique. Yet, there is a common thread that links us to the other on a universal whole.

As spiritual beings in a human body, we are conditioned to aspire great success in our life. A natural role of human conditioning and essential for growth, aspirations and the actions we attach to them are an expression of our unique gifts and talents.

As long as our desire for success benefits ourselves while serving others and impacting the planet in a positive way, bringing more awareness, knowledge, abundance, joy and love, we are on-path for success.

In striving for success, I have become increasing aware of the ways I choose to sacrifice myself. In part, due to my belief system of how I “think” success is attained, and in part, due to wanting to help others succeed, I have at times ignored my truest desires.

While striving for success, do you:

• Push yourself to complete a task when you feel tired?

• Say “yes” when you want to say “no”?

• Settle into a relationship when only 3 out of 5 key elements are met? Do you stay because you believe this is the best you will receive? Do you fear being alone?

• Place attention on small daily tasks finding that by the end of the day you have little energy left for your ultimate creations and enjoyment?

• Spend time with people you do not feel connected to?

• Know what you are FEELING?

Our mind is a powerful tool for keeping us safe, setting intentions and drawing conclusions. It can, however, override our truest needs if we allow it. We’ve all heard how there are thousands of thoughts coming through our minds each day. What is overwhelming is most thoughts are repeatedly negative, nagging, non-loving beliefs that hold us back from our true nature…LOVE.

By listening to the subtle signs and messages provided by our body, particularly the heart (emotional center) and solar plexus (gut feeling), we can tap into our innate knowing for true guidance. In honoring our body’s feelings we can then choose a particular course of action, or non-action.

Often, when we are busy DOING or completing our tasks for success, it is an avoidance of our feelings. Becoming increasingly mindful to what you are doing is the first step to transformation.

Clients and friends regularly seek my guidance for their personal relationships, challenges at work, or how to deepen their connection with spirit. My answer is always drawn from the same conclusion – go inside, feel, and listen. Get to know yourself intimately, examine your beliefs, and understand the motivation behind your actions.

One of the greatest ways we learn about ourselves is through RELATIONSHIP. Relationship with our partner, our husband, our daughter, our brother, our co-worker, and our friend &#8211; everyone we meet will in some way influence us. Often times triggering us, people will teach us by mirroring back what we most need to learn. How others treat you can be a direct reflection of the level of love you have for yourself.

For success BEYOND sacrifice, go inside for direction. Embrace your emotions and recognize your thoughts, express your truths, set boundaries, enjoy good nutrition, exercise, play, laugh and get plenty of rest.

When we are especially stressed, repeating old patterns, or simply feel drawn, then seek external guidance. Read books and listen to CD’s for inspiration, schedule bodywork as prevention for signs of stress and discomfort, experience energy healing for transformation at the cellular level, obtain counseling to understand the body/mind connection, attend workshops or retreats, connect with nature, and whatever else suits your fancy.
