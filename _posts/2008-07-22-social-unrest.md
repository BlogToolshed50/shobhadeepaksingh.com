Social unrest prevails in an increased degree in any Nation due to various factors. First and foremost reason is the disparity in the economic condition with in the same population. Of late the gap between the “Haves” and “Have nots” has gone up and created a very big wedge and social unrest. In the matter of education the downtrodden is ignored and the rich has all the reach to the so called modern education. This sows the seed of hatred in the minds of the youngsters resulting in uncalled for social unrest. In order to mitigate such things the individuals should be taught with the ethics of human value and the need to regard to fellow human being.
