&#8220;Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.&#8221;
  
- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Nightly for many years I lay in my lonely marriage bed and fantasized about what I called “running away from home.” I could never quite see how I’d do it. To keep thinking about it seemed to relieve the pressure of my daily struggle but still no action for 15 years.

Now I realize that my biggest moment of power was when I made the decision to leave my husband. I made a decision. I even trusted it though I had not thought the whole idea through. This time what blossomed in my mind as a result of that decision was the awareness that I could rely on myself. And as important, the decision motivated the actions that followed.

I had heard the voice of my Real Self guiding me and it was in this way that I decided the future of my life. I heard “could” instead of “should” and “want to” instead of “have to”.

The old ego-mind voice was trying to keep everything the same for itself and left a heavy feeling in my gut. The new voice left me feeling uplifted and light. It felt like angels in my heart rather than a pitchfork in my butt.

Tony Robbins is quoted as saying, &#8220;To decide is to cut off any other possibility.&#8221; Making a decision means jumping from one state of mind to another. Before &#8211; I thought and felt this way; now &#8211; I think and feel this new way. Make a decision and it is not hard to follow the new way as it generates a new consciousness and therefore, ideas, knowledge and different-than-before actions follow.

Right-Brain and Left-Brain Decisions:There is right-brain decision making which is intuitive. And, there is left-brain decision-making that is systematic. Above is an example of right-brain decision-making. Intuitive decision-making hides the steps. You make a &#8220;belief-in-your-own-knowing&#8221; leap of faith when you trust and act on this kind of decision.

Recently I made the left-brain, systematic decision when I decided after seeing my cheeks and nose turn bright red from eating too many refined carbohydrates, that I would eat only what I knew was right for my body.
