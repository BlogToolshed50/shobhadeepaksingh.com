These days a good web 2.0 platform immediately becomes popular if it is really good. I could make a similarity measure of the type of products that are becoming popular these days. If I could see word press becoming popular , and Firefox becoming popular, I think its because of the provision for custom design. In word press we can modify the operation and create new features by means of widgets.Â  This facility of providing the ability to custom modify a platform really provides the strength for innovation and helps popularize a product. I think this is one major aspect that must be though while designing a product.
