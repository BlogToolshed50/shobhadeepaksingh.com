Life is a mystery. The cosmos is a mystery. What are its boundaries? If it is an expanding universe, where does it expand to? What is beyond it. Some of the stars are millions of light years away from us. What an unimaginable distance! What is there in the cosmos? Who made it? When did it form? What was there, before it was formed?
  
Who am I? Am I a body with a name? Then how do some people have good luck and some bad? Why do some children get cancer at a very young age and some people with all the bad habits live a healthy life for a long time? What are we destined to do on this earth. Where did we come from and where shall we go?

Why there is so much misery in the world? Why do we love some people and hate some bitterly? What is that, which will satisfy us? What is the objective of human life? There are so many questions in our minds. Every religion has its own theory and its own explanation. In India, it is considered that The Guru is the only one who can answer all these questions.

Who is The Guru? According to ancient Indian scriptures, Guru is God in human body. He comes on this earth to liberate His followers. A Guru is not to be confused with people who write well or speak well about Indian mythology and philosophy. They may be called as learned persons or good speakers or good writers of books. But none of them is The Guru.

The west is increasingly getting attracted to Hinduism and Indian culture. Many practices of Hinduism including Yoga are becoming very popular in the west. Many people travel from India to the west to lecture upon Hinduism and the scriptures of India, and they are called as Gurus. That is wrong use of the word &#8211; Guru. Guru is very mysterious. Guru is not a mere lecturer who sounds very sweet and speaks in a captivating way.

How to know that some one is A Guru? After coming in contact with Guru, you must and will feel a change that is life altering. The change is not something like &#8211; I feel good, or I feel peaceful. The Guru brings about changes that can never be explained by you to others. If any time, you come across Guru, you will know by these changes and then over a period of time The Guru will reveal his/her identity to you. That depends on his/her wish.
  
No one should take every saint in India or anywhere as Guru. There are very few in the world. According to Indian scriptures, only if you have collected lot of good karma, do you get to meet The Guru. I can only make one statement. The experience of the power of Guru is very different than anything else. And in the beginning the experience may be very painful rather than pleasant. But it is said that the end is pure bliss.
