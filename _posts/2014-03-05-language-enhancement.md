The problem with communication is that when people converse and use language, they often times only consider the &#8216;intellectual meaning&#8217; of their language, not knowing the unconscious effect their language has on the listeners, and most importantly, themselves. We program ourselves with language, we program others with language. The &#8216;programming&#8217; I&#8217;m talking about is the unconscious effect of language on a person&#8217;s neurology affecting behaviors and emotional states. This is often the reason for misunderstandings between people, relationship issues, loss of productivity at work, and much more. Miscommunication on the unconscious level is something that very few people know about, but most people do it.

Language Enhancement operates by a simple principle: All Language Is Hypnosis. All conversation involves programming. This means any conversation. Learning how this works will allow anyone to have an advantage in communication.

NLP in part, is the study of how language affects neurology. This was first discovered by Dr. Milton Erickson who was a psychiatrist in the 1950&#8242;s. He was able to induce trance and hypnotic states, place hypnotic commands, and change behaviors while the client thought they were simply involved in a conversation. Later, Dr. Richard Bandler, founder of NLP, created &#8220;The Milton Model of Hypnotic Language&#8221;, as part of NLP training.. Something else was also discovered in the field of Behavioral Research. Everyone on the planet using language and conversation was also using this model, only without knowing it. This meant that people were doing hypnosis on one another all the time, and didn&#8217;t know it. This is where the concept of &#8216;All Language is Hypnosis&#8217; began. People are already using all the principles of Ericksonian Hypnosis with blindfolds on. What would happen if you took that blindfold off, and started to communicate with precision, knowing exactly how your language affected the listener&#8217;s unconscious?

The solution is for people to learn how their language affects the sub-conscious mind. In other words, to teach them the basics of conversational hypnosis. These are skill sets from &#8220;The Milton Model of Hypnotic Language&#8221; and other NLP language skills to develop your language mastery. This will allow you to determine and adjust how your language is affecting the listener&#8217;s unconscious as well as knowing how to better program your own mind using better language. Remember that all people program themselves with their own language.

Your persuasion skills will increase, your clarity in communication will increase, and with these skills you will often be able to tell the meaning behind people&#8217;s words, simply by recognizing how they use their language. This is a set of skills to go well beyond enhancing communication, this set of skills will allow you to program yourself and others hypnotically to produce healthy results.

A Simple Demonstration: This is an exercise on how to program the brain into remembering things.

Avoid using the word &#8216;FORGET&#8217;, start using the word &#8216;REMEMBER&#8217;. This is a way to program yourself and others. If people tell themselves &#8216;not to forget&#8217;, they will often times forget. This is because &#8216;don&#8217;t&#8217; is a negative command for the unconscious to &#8216;do&#8217;, and &#8216;forget&#8217; is a command word for people to forget. Remembering simply involves telling yourself to remember. Since this is a common mistake in language, I&#8217;m sure you will remember this because when you tell your kids to remember to be safe or your significant other to remember the milk on the way home, or your colleagues at work to remember the project is due Monday, they will remember.
