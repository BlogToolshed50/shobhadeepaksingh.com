In the field of Agriculture the insecticides play a vital role in killing the pests that are destroying the crops. The yield is drastically reduced due to the pest incidence in various crops resulting in poor return to the farmers. Of late we observe the infestation by pests is on the increase and the farmers are driven to the level of suicide. In crops like cotton the pests affect to a greater extent and the quality of the produce also gets affected apart from the reduction in the yield.
