Students recently are facing corporal punishments form their school teachers. IT is really important that the students are kept away from the fear of being harassed to perform lesser than average.This is a problem in many countries that the united nations is trying to resolve. Along with the other huge issues of the world from the increasing fuel prices to the peace keeping among countries, student protection is another main issue. I think its great that few countries have taken initiative to change this trend and provide the students a better place to study. In the years to come corporal punishments must be completely banned and the students must be provided a fear free atmosphere for studying.
