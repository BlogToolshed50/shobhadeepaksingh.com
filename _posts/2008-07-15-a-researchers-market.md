When people perform a research in their technology and come up with a new product, most of them fall in love wiht heir invention before knowing what the market needs. When such products enter the market without much market research and only the inventor loving his product, Things can get haywire. It is really a shattering moment for the inventor to realize that people don&#8217;t love his product as much as he does and this ends up with a product failure. Thus it is really important to perform a fair amount of market research before actually developing the product with full strength. Market research is one of the first few steps that must be performed even before starting the smallest of business, weather online of off line.
