We all love Disney . It real old cartoons have been real fascination to all of us. I had seen great youtube videos about how good the efforts were since they had to redraw each of the slides every time they wanted a new move from the character. Disney park in Los angels is really a great tourist attraction. Disney has started up many ventures in various fields diverging from their primary works. They have also started radio and media alongside their original cartoon and theme park based business. Disney is going to conduct a summer radio concert in Wildwood, New Jersey at Morey’s Piers in the month of July . The best part of this is that , the concert is free for people to attend and will be attended by top disney artists and thus will be great fun.

The website says that &#8220;Morey’s Piers is a great place for a “New Jersey Vacation”.&#8221; and it sure is since , what best cab it be if you get to see the concert free and go around new jersey. If you are looking for Things to do in New Jerseythen this is it. This is a great chance for New Jersey vacation. Their schedule shows great shows on july 7th, and july 26th . I would recommend visiting their website an knowing the latest news and happenings about the event.
