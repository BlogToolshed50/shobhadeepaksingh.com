one of the most important requirement of having a good laptop is a good battery life. The marketing factor of many models of laptop in the market these days are the battery life. I wonder how the battery technology is still not able to keep up with the development of electronics. My lenovo thinkpad promises around 7 hours of <span></span>time but it just manages to give around 4 hours. This is one of the best available in the market today, which itself is not all that impressive to me. This is the problem faced by most electronic industries these days. Hopefully markets come up with better battery technology in future.
