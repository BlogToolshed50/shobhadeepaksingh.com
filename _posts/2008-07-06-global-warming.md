It has become a great concern for every one on earth to combat increasing global warming.

Aggravated by the increasing carbon emission from the accelerated industrialization,
  
increased usage of petrol products in the vehicular traffic the global warming goes unabated.
  
It may turn out to be more problematic due to the melting of the glaciers due to the increased
  
global temperature. Deforestation embarked to increase the infrastructure facilities ,and 

construction activities too has aggravated the situation.Though sporadic efforts are being taken in the form of going in for afforestation and other measures it is time that every one should think sensibly how he/she can play a role in averting this danger.
