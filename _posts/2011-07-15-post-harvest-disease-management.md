In the present world where every nation is worried about the food security, it is imperative that we should go in for the proper post harvest disease management strategies. This will help us protect the fresh fruits and vegetables from the attack of the pathogenic micro organisms and ensure better life for the harvested fruits and vegetables.

The conventional method is to ensure proper sanitation in the place of storage of those produces. Of course, keeping the fruits and vegetables in a modified controlled atmosphere is an old, but very effective technique to preserve them against the attack by various pathogens. We can employ radiation and the ultra violet illuminations to manage the post harvest pests affecting the quality of fruits and vegetables.
