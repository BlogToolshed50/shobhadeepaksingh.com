Are you ready to help the environment, get some fresh air and exercise, and have fun with family and friends? Consider volunteering at a beach cleanup, either locally or during your next vacation.

My first experience with a beach cleanup was at the Loreto Bay National Marine Park, during our family’s “eco-tourism resort” vacation. One easy-going day I sat in a hammock and saw my wife and sons carry empty trash bags down to the beach. Between reading a novel and napping (yes, I’m the lazy one) I watched them stroll back and forth across the sand, often stopping to pick something up. After a few hours they returned tired, dirty and smiling with an impressive collection of beer bottles, candy wrappers, and cigarette butts. After returning home, putting my watch back on, and returning to work, I realized that the vision of that spur of the moment volunteer exercise had stayed with me. I concluded that we should be doing this same kind of service in our own community.

The easiest way to get started in this endeavor is to find a non-profit organization that runs cleanups. Just enter “beach cleanup” or “coastal cleanup” into your favorite search engine to find out when and where they are signing up volunteers. In some counties, cleanups are organized every Saturday, plus the day after a major holiday when beach crowds are expected.

When you get there, some organizations provide plastic bags, rubber gloves and even trash grippers. It helps to read their Web site or call first and find out what they provide. Your group might even get a gift after your day of volunteering, such as tickets to a fair or an ice cream from Ben & Jerry’s.

If you can’t find an organized cleanup, consider organizing one yourself, with groups such as local schools, scout troops, or church groups. If not, you can just head out there with some family, friends, or co-workers and plenty of empty trash bags.

Here are some tips to make the cleanup easy, safe and fun:

* Dress for working outdoors. Wear good walking shoes, a comfortable top and pants with lots of freedom of movement, plus a hat and sunglasses.

* Bring rubber gloves to protect your hands from filth and sharp edges, if the trash is handled carefully.

* Bring a long-handled trash grabber/gripper tool to protect your hands and save your lower back from too much bending down. The tool is especially good for picking up broken bottles.

* If you bring the kids, organize yourselves into two-person teams. One person carries the bag and the other picks up the litter.

* Don’t forget the drinking water and sunscreen.

You’ll be surprised at how many cigarette butts, soda straws, plastic cups and shredded clothes you can find in two hours. And if you pick up the broken pieces of a beer bottle, think about all the kids’ feet you might have protected.

As always, thanks for volunteering!
