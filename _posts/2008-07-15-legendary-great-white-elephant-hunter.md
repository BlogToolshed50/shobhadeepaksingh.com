This is one short story that made its way into the internet and talks about business strategies. There is an old story that talks about a legendary great white elephant hunter in which this hunter hears about a white elephant ad wants to hunt it. So he sets into the jungle with his team and was never seen again. This story at the first glance might not make the impact I am trying to bring out but it correlates perfectly to a sales executive who is trying to make a sale. with salespersons trying to catch the great white elephant, tend to organize so much hiding the truth that they will never get the deal. Most sales people know if they can strike the rapport with a client in 1 or 2 meetings. Instead of sales persons avoiding failure for long, its better to be clear if the client really wants the deal and go ahead and move on with other clients if they did not want it at all.
