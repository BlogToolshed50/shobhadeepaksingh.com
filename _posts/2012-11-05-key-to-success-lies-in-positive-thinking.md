Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.&#8221;
  
- John H. Miller

All of us face problems in our lives. But positive thinking keeps us going and helps us overcome the challenges. Any situation when looked at from a positive perspective gives us strength to carry on and move beyond the limitations.

Take the case of Suzanne who always dream&#8217;t of being a ballet dancer. Suzanne would go to audition after audition after audition but never got selected. She kept worrying about other contestants being more talented than she was and what others might say about her performance … and this affected her performance.

Suzanne could not understand why, despite learning ballet for so many years, she was not able to land a good role which could justify her talent. She always thought that others could not see the real potential in her and felt unjustifiably overlooked. She did not realize that the real problem lay in her own doubts and apprehensions which were making her nervous.

Constant worry and negative thinking occupies the mind with fearful scenarios and blocks constructive ideas and thoughts. Just like Suzanne, there are a large number of such people who have the potential but because of their negative thinking they are unable to accomplish what they desire. Negative thoughts wear you down and make you less effective in achieving your goals and realizing your dreams.

Develop a habit of thinking positive

&#8220;Forget about all the reasons why something may not work. You only need to find one good reason why it will.&#8221;
  
- Dr. Robert Anthony

If you want to achieve success in life, you have to let go of your negative thinking and work towards nurturing and believing in yourself and your positive thoughts which enable even ordinary people to accomplish extraordinary things.

Remember what we are or what we become is the result of our own thoughts. When we have negative thoughts, we focus our energies on what we are not being able to achieve and fear of failure clouds our confidence. On the other hand when we make effort to think positively, our thoughts automatically become aligned with what we can accomplish and we feel confident about our capabilities.

But you have to keep in mind that attitudes do not change overnight. You have to consciously make efforts to develop that kind of positive frame of mind. What we speak and think form our future.

So instead of thinking all the time and saying I cant, I wont … say I can, I will, It is possible, and repeat these positive affirmations to your self again and again. And try to visualize the outcomes you desire in vivid detail. See them already complete and in their most perfect state. Imagine what it would feel like, and act as if it is already yours. The idea is to direct your positive thoughts for what you desire, and you will begin to attract into your life the circumstances necessary to manifest your dreams.
