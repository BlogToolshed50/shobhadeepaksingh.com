Most people don&#8217;t understand what refurbished really means. Many think that those are defective pieces returned by customer during use and which are set right. There is a great difference in a repaired product and a refurbished product. When a company produces in mass, there is a quality check and there can be cases where the product could be rejected because it got a small scratch or its button fell off and many other reasons. In such cases instead of throwing the product away, the company invests in repairing it and reselling it as refurbished. This is a great thing for consumers who want to enjoy the technology at low prices. since a refurbished item is nothing but a new item, there is nothing wrong in buying a refurbished item as far as I understand. GO ahead and pick the cheapest quality products in the market. !!
