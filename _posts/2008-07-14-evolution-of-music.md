There we days when having a portable music system was a dream for many people. Trends among US youngsters have changed quite rapidly with the advent of newer technology. Huge Disk players almost went extinct even before they made any impact on the market. It was a clear display of how a better technology overran the existing weaker one. With the latest Ipod and various other small gadgets that could help much better songs and the traditional systems, they are gaining speed. With that said, the previous Iphone drastically fell down in price with the release of the new Iphone 3G. Technology industry can earn a billion dollars but the risk of people easily jumping ships with newer technology is something that is not avoidable.
