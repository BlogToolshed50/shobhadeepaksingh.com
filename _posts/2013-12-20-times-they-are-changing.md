The past few months have been quite overwhelming for many … First we had to deal with a very incompetent leadership in our government (USA readers), then a derailed economy that has been scarring the wits out of many. And now, a new president-elect who promises to bring the changes we need, with everyone’s help and contribution. I am not one to bring up politics in my discourse, but this got me thinking about change.

What is change really? How is it done and how do we respond (or react) to it? As far as I can remember, I have always enjoyed change in my life. I am not a “routine” person and I have moved many times because I truly love creating a new home wherever I go. I have lived in Paris, in New York City, in Colorado, in New Mexico, in California, and in Connecticut! Of course, in each of these states, I lived in several different homes! Does that make me unstable? Maybe in the eyes of some, but not in mine. I just like change.

Well … wait a minute! These changes were my choice, every single time. Isn’t it easy to like change you want? For me it is. How about change that is imposed onto me by others? Come to think of it, I am not sure I like change that much, after all. Okay, I am being silly. But really, when people say they don’t like change, it is because they resist being changed by someone else or by some particular circumstance. They don’t like to feel like they are losing control. So, here are some key questions to ask yourself when change is in the air:

1. Is this change my choice or is it imposed by someone/something else?
  
2. How will this change affect my life?
  
3. How can I make the best out of this change? Where is the opportunity for me in this?

When change is imposed by circumstances out of our control, it is best to find the benefits we can create with it, instead of complaining, feeling victimized or afraid, or fighting it. You know, everything changes constantly, nothing ever stays the same … except for one thing: change is always inevitable! Think of it this way: It’s like being in a small row boat in the middle of a big ocean, and the current is pushing your boat in a direction you didn’t plan. What do you do? Although you let the currents take you where they want, you use the paddles to gently correct the direction so you can use the wind to your benefit, you don’t go against current and wind.
