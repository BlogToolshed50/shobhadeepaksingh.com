It is impressive how the company made it so big in quite some good time. It takes stuff to develop such a company. Even today the company is solely funded by its search engine venture. The day google will collapse is the day when people think of some other web search engine to do better than google. I am a dedicated follower of google, I always use only google to perform my search . But trust me, there are search engines that are better in many aspect than google. I found recently that yahoo search really brings up good results that even google could never crawl . I will not come to a conclusion is google is not better just because of this, but this is a good indicator that google is not the best in all aspects. Thus we&#8217;ll need to find better customizations in our search and chose the best search engine to perform the search accordingly.
