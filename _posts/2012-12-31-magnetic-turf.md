Some of the time, the sun&#8217;s alluring pasture has an easy overall shape. At extra times, the field is enormously complex. The trouble-free field resembles the field that would be in attendance if the sun&#8217;s axis of revolving were a huge bar attraction. You can see the shape of a bar magnet&#8217;s field by conducting an experiment with iron filings. Place a sheet of term paper on a bar magnet and then drop iron filings on the paper. The filings will form a pattern that reveals the shape of the magnetic field. Many of the filings will gather in D-shaped loops that tie the ends of the magnet.

Physicists characterize the field in terms of made-up lines that grant rise to the loops of filings. These lines are call field lines, flux lines, or lines of force. Scientists allot these lines a bearing, and the bar draw is said to have a compelling north pole at one end and a compelling south pole at the extra end. The fields lines go out of the draw from the North Pole, loop about, and come back to the draw at the South Pole.

The ground of the sun&#8217;s magnetic field is, in part, the pressure group of the convection cells. Any electrically charged object can create a magnetic field simply by moving. The convection cells, which are composed of positive ions and electrons, flow in a way that helps create the solar field.

When the sun&#8217;s magnetic field becomes complex, field lines resemble a kinked, twisted garden hose. The field develops kinks and twists for two reasons: (1) The sun rotates extra rapidly at the equator than at higher latitude, and (2) the inner parts of the sun rotate more rapidly than the surface. The difference in rotational speed stretch field lines in an easterly direction. Eventually, the lines become so unclear that the kinks and twists develop.

In some areas, the field is thousands of times stronger than the overall compelling field. In these places, clusters of field lines break from first to last the shell, creating loops in the solar mood. At one end of the loop, the breakthrough point is a magnetic north pole. At this point, the direction of the field lines is rising &#8212; that is, away from the core. At the further end of the loop, the breakthrough point is a magnetic south pole, and the lines point downward. A sunspot forms at each point. The field lines guide ions and electrons into the breathing space above the sunspots, producing huge loops of gas.

The number of sunspots on the sun depends on the quantity of distortion in the field. The change in this number, from a minimum to a maximum and back to a least amount, is identified as the sunspot cycle. The average age of the sunspot cycle is about 11 years.

At the end of a sunspot cycle, the compelling fields quickly reverse its polarity and lose most of its buckle. Suppose the sun&#8217;s compelling North Pole and its geographic north pole were at the same place at the sound of a given cycle. At the commencement of the next cycle, the magnetic north pole would be at the same rest as the geographic South Pole. A vary of polarity from one direction to the other and reverse again equals the periods of two succeeding sunspot cycle and is therefore about 22 years.
