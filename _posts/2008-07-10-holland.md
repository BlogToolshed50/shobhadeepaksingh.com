Holland is a great place to visit. But is two hours enough to go around Holland? lets get to know. I read an article in the newspaper that claimed so. With 12 minutes of our time it said we can go ahead and have a look at Holland!! The place is called &#8220;Madurodam&#8221; which is located in Scheveningen. It is a miniature city that has been created to perfection and had a small depiction of Holland and its spirit. Its culture is depicted by means of this small place that is the dutch prototype of the American Disney land. But I really like the compaction in which you can go around and get a feel of the whole country in just about 2 hours!! Great.
