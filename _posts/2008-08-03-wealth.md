The<span> </span>remaining<span> </span>energy and<span> </span>time is<span> </span>spent<span> </span>in<span> </span>managing the<span> </span>wealth<span> </span>and the other<span> </span>aspects<span> </span>in the life<span> </span>is<span> </span>given a go bye. It<span> </span>may<span> </span>not be<span> </span>out<span> </span>of place to mention that he wealth<span> </span>added<span> </span>in a generation<span> </span>after<span> </span>scarifying lot<span> </span>of<span> </span>thins<span> </span>in the personal<span> </span>life<span> </span>is<span> </span>used by the next<span> </span>generation to lead a life<span> </span>with out<span> </span>any<span> </span>ethics resulting <span> </span>in<span> </span>social unrest.
