If you look at the life of a fisherman , you will notice how difficult it is to earn a livelihood. It is one of the most difficult professions to be in since you are entirely dependent on nature for your living. If it rains a day, you have no food. This is an awesome example of how efforts don&#8217;t match rewards. This is because the efforts of a person in that job is way higher than someone who has a software job. This clearly states that the efforts are not the sole indicator of success. Efforts plus the situation can determine success. But on the other hand, success can be a relative term. What a person can call success would not be considered so by the other person. Well lets leave the topic for time being and feel compassionate about people who are less privileged.
