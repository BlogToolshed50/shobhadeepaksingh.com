Human development index of a country or a State is measured based on the literacy level, per capita income and gross domestic product per head. It indicates the health of a country in terms of human resources.Globally this sort of measurement to weigh the country and any State for that matter is gaining momentum rather than the conventional indicators.

At present certain developing countries like China and India are showing remarkable improvement in the Human Development index.
