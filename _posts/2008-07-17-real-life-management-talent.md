If your are an independent business owner then you must look into various business aspects of your company. Management is a talent that you should harness as time goes by.To learn real time management it is important to look into your own business and develop over experiences from that. Most people learn good management skills as they work on their business. No business school int eh world can give u experiences similar to learning from real life management experience. One of my friend completed his MBA in one of the best universities abroad and later happened to startup and failed badly. After his first failure he learnt so much that he made a great business man in future.
