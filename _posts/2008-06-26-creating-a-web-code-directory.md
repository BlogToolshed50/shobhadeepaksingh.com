I have recently been thinking about creating a good web directory that us useful to people. The recent web scenario is that the content of a website must e community based. This means that the community should be able to participate in the contribution of the website. There are two types of website in this regard, ones that don&#8217;t use the community strength for the development of their site like in w3schools.com or the ones that run solely based on community contributions like the phpclasses.com . These have their extreme effects and so I am planning to develop a database that has a mixture or owned content and community content.
