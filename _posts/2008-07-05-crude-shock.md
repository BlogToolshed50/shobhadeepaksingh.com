World is facing the music of confronting what it never wanted in terms of exorbitant oil price.
  
In fact the developing countries are suffering to a greater extent since they are in a predicament to balance the oil driven inflation and the growth rate.Few countries are in the verge of economical collapse due to the phenomenal inflationary pressure resulting even in political instability.

OPEC is no mood to relent to the fervent appeal by the consumers but bent upon to increase the price in the days to come.Production level though they say is in commensuration with the demand speculative trade in oil has driven the price sky high.
