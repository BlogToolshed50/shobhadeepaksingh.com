In august this year, there is a great culinary competition to be held in Louisiana. It is the famous seafood Cook offconducted by Louisiana Seafood Promotion & Marketing Board and NOAA. This is a stage where the best American sea food chefs compete with each other for the title. This is the fifth year that this even is being held backed by the grand success in its previous years. It is really a great occasion for the American people to rediscover their taste for good sea food.

I recently made good prawns at home. My friends were delighted by the dish. It was pretty simple and quick to make. I boiled the prawns along with some salt for more than 20 minutes. I topped it with various greens and added some olive oil. You then have to keep it in the oven for about 30 minutes at 375*C . You then will let it cool down and stuff it in between bread sticks. You can top it with some cheese and mustard. This was a recipe that I came up with myself. and amazingly all were delighted with it. I think Following this contest will give me better cooking skills when it comes to sea foods.
