Methane gas is used to generate energy for human use.Every country is investing billions of amount to install plants to produce energy.Methane gas that emanates from the degradable bio waste is an essential component to generate energy in the form of electricity. Both organic and non organic degradable waste materials are put under Oxygen free atmosphere at a temperature of 65degree C which enables the bacteria to extricate the methane gas.
