Belief is the main factor in anyone&#8217;s life that leads him towards success. Everyone is born to win. If this belief percolates down to the mind of the individual he develops the needed impetus to reach the goal. One should basically believe in himself that he is capable of achieving the things he wishes to achieve in the life. He should develop this important trait by seeing the people who achieve with this belief. Recent snatching of Eight Gold medals by Mr. Phelps. By birth everyone is born equal. The belief and conviction that one develops during the course of his growth determines the destination where he will reach. Hence, a strong belief will help a person to be a successful one.
