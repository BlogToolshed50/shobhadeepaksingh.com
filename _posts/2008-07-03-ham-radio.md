I went through the details about joining and things that you can do being a HAM… Man truly worth it. The most interesting thing that i came across was Connection you HAM to your COMPUTER (Hmmm) and talking to astronaut.Becoming a HAM is not too difficult a job. Just write few tests and learn a bit and get your Tx transmit and communicate. Chill even i felt so. Well you can as there’s a HAM up there on the satellite and astronaut there do communicate to HAMs on earth the claim.What… talking to an astronaut. Ha he doest live next door.Cool. Now i really want know how this is done and get going!!
  
By becoming a HAM You will actually build your own amateur transmitter and reciever and will be able to communicate with other HAMS around the world.I guess most of you would have read about HAM radio operators by now, though I am not a HAM yet but will soon be one hopefully.
