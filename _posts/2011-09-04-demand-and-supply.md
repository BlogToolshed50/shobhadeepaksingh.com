Demand and supply mismatch has created the panic in many parts of the world in the food front. Many countries are dependent on the imports from various other countries to feed their population. If the supply chain is cutoff due to the embargo by the exporting countries the cost of food rises and at times result in short supply leading to chaos. When the domestic demand increased the rice producing country like Thailand and India put a ban on the export of rice items which had created shortage in many countries in the Middle East. As such, each nation is to create the source to produce the requisite food items to avoid such crisis.
