As the news is being reported how the yahoo employees are slowly moving out of the company, yahoo desperately is trying to keep up its pace. This attempt recently lead to something funny. Yahoo has a great variety or services that makes it a unique company of its own. But since gmail has clearly overtaken yahoo in its market share, yahoo is desperately trying to get its audience back. In this effort they happened to buy a new domain named ymail.com and rocketmail.com. Now that sounds something like gmail to me and sounds really funny.
