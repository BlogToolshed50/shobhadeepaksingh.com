The world is seeing greater increase in the number of products driven by modern technology. The number of mobile phone is increasing each day. It is really an irony how people have still not questioned the side effects of using a mobile phone despite its ubiquitous presence. Though researchers are deeply analyzing the side effects of using mobile phones, they say that the it will be clearly evident only after few years. But I am sure that before the effects of using a technology like a mobile phone is clearly known, it will be a big part of our life and most of us will not be able to fore go it at any cost. Most humans will end up living with this necessary evil.
