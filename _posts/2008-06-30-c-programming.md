C has been there since the 1970&#8242;s when someone really came up with new stuff in the field of programming.After the C mania C++ was developed for those who felt that C was a bit less. The best aspect of a C++ programming language is that , it is more of a language tool rather than a language itself. It can actually develop itself and build on oneself more like a boot strap. The best way to learn C is to site down and start writing our oun code over time.
