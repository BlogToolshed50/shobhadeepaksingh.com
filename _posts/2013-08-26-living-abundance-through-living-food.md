In studying Universal Laws of Abundance, it is vital to take care to not neglect the health and wellness aspect of the law. When individuals choose to study Divine Laws such as, the Law of Giving, the Law Attraction, the Law of Abundance, an eagerness to see the manifestation of the material aspect of wealth is usually the driving force. But how many realize that if one fails to achieve good health or neglects to understand the importance of having an alkaline living food diet, then the abundance and enjoyment of money will be short lived? Becoming holistic encompasses the “whole” self uniting in harmony with each part—body, mind, and spirit.

Think of your body the way a farmer tills the soil. Your body, just like the soil of the earth, extracts nutrients from the food it’s given. Enzymes, which are found in (living and raw) foods, aid in the process of digestion (transporting nutrients to the cells). By choosing alkaline rich foods, (foods with a ph level of 7.0 or higher), these foods contain vital and living enzymes which aid in the digestion and the absorption of nutrients. These nutrients are extracted from the food by the body through the process of assimilation. If the food is alive, then the process of digestion is easier. The nutrients are then distributed to the cells and then the healing of the body begins.

“Let thy food be thy medicine” is a proverb that has been used in indigenous cultures all over the world for thousands of years. But if the food is void of nutrition, then the healing process is compromised. According to Wellness Educator, Carmellita Brown:

“For the average person, 80% percent of what we eat has no nutritional value. About 40% of the foods we consume are meats and animal products such as milk, cheese, butter, which have nutrients, but these nutrients do not assimilate well in the Human body. We eat it because we enjoy the way it tastes and because it gives us a temporary sense of fullness. The other 40% is processed foods such as pastas, breads, canned foods, and frozen foods. Only about 20% of what we eat is actually raw fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds. This ratio not only promotes anaerobic pathogens, it also causes obesity, nerve damage, allergies, and stress.”

Making simple dietary changes need not be painful. For many of us, there is a very real fear of becoming socially isolated and deprived of good tasting food because of changes in dietary choices. Taste is important and does not have to be discarded when making a selection of good healthful foods. The days of the Scarsdale Diet are over. You don’t have to eat bland, tasteless, putrid looking foods in order to achieve optimal health. Here is a recipe that includes a few key foods that can be incorporated into any diet:

1 head of red leaf lettuce
  
1 cucumber
  
2 whole tomatoes
  
1 clove of garlic
  
2 avocados
  
1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar
  
2 teaspoons of Cold Press Extra Virgin Olive Oil
  
Dash of mustard
  
Season to taste with dill weed, sea salt, and basil (dry or fresh)
  
Dash of Celtic “gray” Sea Salt to taste

Chop lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber. Finely mince garlic and mix together. Slice avocados into strips and add vinegar and mustard. Add seasonings and toss all ingredients together. Enjoy

The dill mixed with the avocado will give a rich, creamy, and buttery type taste to the salad. Enjoy the many therapeutic proprieties of the food such as, apple cider vinegar (raising metabolism, cutting appetite), tomatoes (cancer fighting agent) and garlic (reduces high blood pressure).

There’s no need to be in conflict when choosing good, healthful foods. Here a few tips to keep in mind. When incorporating holistic foods into the diet always:

1. Remember when choosing foods, don’t be afraid of Green.
  
Green is associated with prosperity and growth. Romaine Lettuce, Kale, Spinach, Bok Choy are enzyme rich, low calorie foods that can be the base of any salad. Imagine the leafy leaves of lettuce flushing away toxins.

2. Don’t let too much brown hang around
  
Unless it’s brown because it’s a raw nut, seed, or grain, more than likely the thing you are looking at is a “dead” processed or fried food. Remember processed foods have “0” nutritional value; meaning that over time it physically wears and tears down the body.

3. If the label is too long, put it down
  
Additives and foreign agents are usually included in foods with lengthy labels. The body won’t recognize those chemicals and therefore will not be able to digest them.

4. Add fruit for breakfast
  
Don’t be afraid to experiment. Nature has given humanity thousands of exotic fruits to choose from. Apples, oranges, and bananas are fine, but Mango, Bosc Pears, black plums, passion fruit, and papayas are a great way to start off any day.

Making small steps towards optimal health need not be taxing or painful. The earth is plentiful. And as you begin to take steps towards your health, Abundance of the mind, body, and Spirit will be achieved.
