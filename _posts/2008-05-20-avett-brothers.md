old rock songs are really an awesome bunch of music, I never was much interested in these music but recently I have learned a lot about old rock music which has kindled my interest recently. This is a great thing how I have been not aware of this great form of music for a long time now. Avett brothers is a beautiful collection that I would recommend any rock band guy to listen to. Their albums of &#8216;Will you return&#8217; , &#8216;Die Die Die&#8217; are their best that I have listened to. Like any good author writes really a small collection, they too have a really small collection of songs. Decemberist are their closest neighbors who compose music similar to them.
