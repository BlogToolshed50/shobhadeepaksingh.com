Hydrogen based fuel cars are slowly being introduced into the market. a water based car can provide you double the mileage that is given by a normal car and would provide environmental solution for gas problem. The advantages of a water run car fas exceeds the one running in gas, but why has it still not been popularized and people made aware? Is there any fundamental issue that is keeping people from buying those hydrogen ones? well I guess people are just not made aware of it and that is the problem that it has not become popular among customers. Thee has to be a major initiative to convince people to purchase the new age automobile. I hope that in the decades to come people will start accepting the advantages for water as fuel.
