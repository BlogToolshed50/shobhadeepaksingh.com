It is greatly a concern that the education system must catch up with the industry. This problem of educational institutions lagging behind the state-of-the-art techniques used in the industries has been long talked about. This problem primarily comes to the underlying concept that it takes time to teach students the latest techniques. The industry did not evolve great techniques overnight, but it took a great number of decades to come up with the techniques that are in use today. This is clearly indicating the time that is needed for students to catch up with the latest technique after learning the fundamentals. I think this gap will always remain and is almost impossible to set right.
