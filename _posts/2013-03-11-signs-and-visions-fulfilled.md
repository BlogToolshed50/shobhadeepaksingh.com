Faith in God, faith in yourself, faith in goodness. George tells of the adversity he faced that led to his journey down the path of fervent faith. If you have ever wavered in your faith, Joel George&#8217;s story will set you on the path to belief. If your faith is strong, you will understand and celebrate his story.

&#8220;When you are going through something like I have,&#8221; George says, &#8220;some people do not like to see that you can still smile and have joy and be thankful to the Lord while you are going through your suffering.&#8221;

George&#8217;s story captures the relationship between suffering and faith. He was tested in his beliefs in many ways, yet he still held strong to his ideology. From being cheated out of paychecks, to being accused of selling drugs and abducting a young woman, George held fast to his belief in God and was rewarded with happiness and joy in his faith. His relationship with his Pastor and the Elders of his church saw him through many hard times and renewed his faith again and again. Each time he felt like he was falling from grace, he found a sign to reaffirm his faith.

George offers his unique outlook on the Christian religion. He devotes a great deal of space in his book to quote scripture and relate what the passages mean to him, personally.

&#8220;I hope that someone doesn&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m trying to persuade them. I am just giving my testimony,&#8221; he explains.

George expresses his belief that those who suffer become closer to God as a result of their suffering. He is very steadfast in his beliefs, stating that, &#8220;When you see the goodness in someone, you see God.&#8221;

He is also very strong in his belief that forgiveness is a key component to a life of faith.

&#8220;You cannot get into heaven with hate in your heart,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You see, if some people would turn down the hate and exercise love, we can overcome. The first thing people should do is learn how to forgive one another.&#8221;

Joel George&#8217;s story is the epitome of the saying &#8220;patience is a virtue.&#8221; His suffering lasted over many years, yet with faith and determination, he triumphed over it. A poem written to George by his friend Patricia Sudler &#8211; and included in the book &#8211; is evidence of the qualities he exemplified to overcome his trials.

&#8220;There are wonderful people who give from their hearts in thoughtful and unselfish ways, so willing to share, help out, or be there, no matter how busy their days.&#8221;
