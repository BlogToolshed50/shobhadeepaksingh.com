There was an antique jewelery festival at NAC which comprised of 500 different varieties of ornamental pieces, each of the jeweleries were uniquely designed and were just too good a collection. There had been a display of fine antique chettinad and nagercoil style jeweleries. There was an amazing collection of pendants. There had been similar shows held before in USA. These collections are a real precious hobby since they transcend time and are really a result of hard work. The NAC comprises of over 500 companies that join together to produce such rare collections. With a personal love for art I really like reading such news and writing about them.
