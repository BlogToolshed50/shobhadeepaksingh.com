How many times were you frustrated looking out for new credit card offer. I am sure, most of us have gone through this great pain of trying to find a good credit card that suits our needs best. The problem with this search is that, we need to go to each website to find about the cards that those companies provide. Since recent timesthere were not much facilities were we could perform a complete credit card search all under one roof. Cardhub has solved our problem by providing an integrated credit card search. Their website provides a user friendly interface on the left where you can set the preferences for your credit card. It is very interactive and works great. I was impressed when my first preference returned 77 cards in the offers. You will like the interface since with each option that you change, it will automatically search the cards and tell you the best ones that suit you. when I searched for a card, I could compare two different companies in one page and understand the benefits that one company had over the other. I could clearly analyze the intro APR, annual APR and other important things that we need to consider while comparing two credit cards. This was the easiest credit card search that I have ever done and it was so comfortable. Once you select the card you will be taken directly to the company&#8217;s website where you can Apply for a Credit Card
