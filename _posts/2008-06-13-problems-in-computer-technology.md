It is really ironic how these days young people engage in computer based work even when they are very much aware of the hazards cause by this industry. The whole Indian economy is running based on computer industry and so many people are making their daily bread just because this industry is thriving. But there are so many hazards that is clearly known to occur for people spending a lot of time on the Internet and the computer. We were having one great debate in our workshop where we were debating if technology is good or bad. We realized that most people wanted to have technology bein aware of the hazards than not using technology.
