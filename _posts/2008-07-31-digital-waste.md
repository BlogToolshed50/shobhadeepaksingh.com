As the world is discussing about the various issues that are surfacing due to pollution and lack of care from humans. There is a large amount of digital waste that is being let into the atmosphere at a constant phase. CD&#8217;s and DVD&#8217;s are one of the most important pollutants. These are freely disposed by humans not knowing that they re not degradable and will exists till the lifetime of earth. They are toxic by themselves and can cause serious damage if they enter the water system. With such wastes increasing each day, it is really important to do our two cents to protect the environment.
