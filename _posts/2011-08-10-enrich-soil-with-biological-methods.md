Biological control of pests in the field of agriculture has become imperative as a cost effective option. It is environmental friendly. The pests that develop resistance to a particular pesticide due to frequent usage is destroyed by such biological methods. The caterpillars in the groundnut crops are destroyed by the biological control using trichoderma. Even the caterpillars that are killed are used again in controlling the left out population of their own species by mixing them with the fresh solution of the biological materials. This reduces the cost of pest control to very great extent.
