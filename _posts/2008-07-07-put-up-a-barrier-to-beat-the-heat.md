Heat is a great problem during the summer. good construction practices can easily put the heat away and will provide a perfect first step in beating the heat. The Insulation method that I will discuss in my next post will protect your home form the heat entering your room. It is better to prevent the heat from coming into your room than letting it heat up your room and then cool it with an AC. It is best to beat the heat right before it enters your room so the insulation over the RCC can really help you beat the heat.
