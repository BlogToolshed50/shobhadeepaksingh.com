* Remember, if you don't make the request, it will NEVER happen. 

Wayne Gretzky once said, "One hundred percent of the shots I don't make don't go in." Likewise, the unasked question is never answered. 

* Don't beat around the bush. 

Just ask! 

* If it's an extraordinary request, say so. 

BIG requests are often the best requests. Be 100% upfront and honest about what you want and what's involved. 

* If the request is work that YOU normally (or should) do, explain 
why you can't. 

You don't need to provide tons of
detail, but again, be honest with the person you're making the request of (and with yourself). 

* Don't assume you know what the answer will be. 

Maybe they'll say "No." Of course, they might say "Yes." 

* Recognize that the person *can* say "No." 

You may not like it, but it will happen from time to time. Accept it and move on. 

* Make one request at a time. 

Asking for help, assistance, changes, etc., is fine, but don't overwhelm a person with multiple requests all at once. 

* Make the request clear and distinct. 

If there's an exact way it needs to be done, let the person 
know. Give them all the information to make a good decision, but also so 
they can really do what you need them to do. 

* Trust the person to do the right thing. 

If you've made your request clear and the person has said that 
they'll do itFeature Articles, expect they'll do it correctly. Don't follow them around and 
hound them about it. 

* Say "Thank you." (Even if they turn you down.)
