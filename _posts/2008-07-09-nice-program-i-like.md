There are so many catchy programs that are aired in the television. It is awesome that they are really creative. There are many program that are reality shows. There is one program on Natgeo that is just too goo and talks about the dangerous survival stories of security officer conflicts. And how the prison is racially divided by crime. Now the question of how there is racial discrimination in crime: well the gangs are decided in to small petty thieves and big criminals. I like watching the show at Lockdown . It is telecast at 9 pm on Natgeo.
