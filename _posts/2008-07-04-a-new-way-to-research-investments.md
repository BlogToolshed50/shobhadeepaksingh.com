There exists many online wiki. Most of them deal with providing valuable information to the readers.Since wiki are maintained by a group of knowledgeable people, we can always rely on the informations provided in them.I came across a new wiki named wikiinvest.com that deals about investment and has really fresh and amazing content. The main page has information related to top multi national companies like Microsoft, Apple , Jive soft and Autodesk. It deals with up to date information regarding investments in the area of oil trading, housing , stocks and numerous other areas of investment that we might be interested in.

I really like the website since its writing style is very professional and clear. I wanted to look for information regarding Baltic Dry Index which was clearly available only at www.wikinvest.com.Baltic dry Index ( BDI) is the daily average of prices to ship raw materials. It represents an overall economic indicator since it shows where the end prices are heading for items that use the raw materials that are shipped in dry bulk. Such clear ideas are presented at wikinvest which has really made me subscribe to them.

The most catchy aspect of the wiki is their elegant design that provides a very professional outlook to the whole website.
