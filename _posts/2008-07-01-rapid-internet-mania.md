Recently I have started a blog , which I planned to slowly develop over a span of two years. I have started with small posts that talk about various aspects of my own life.Â  I also have talked about various things that are happening in the field of technology and how the world is progressing at a rapid rate with time. Its just 3/4 days now that Google has also indexed my blogs and various websites have also linking back to my posts. This shows how rapidly the internet is growing and the number of users who find posts from every corner of the internet.
