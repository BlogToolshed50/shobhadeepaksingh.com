This is a small typical story which I happed to read somewhere online. I was thinking of a beautiful full moon night when I was haunted by a ghost. All white , pale and deadly old ghost that requested race from me. I went about asking how I could give it peace. It was having a gloomy look at the state of the world and how the world was functioning today. The day it died was it born, and since the has been seeing how mean the world is becoming by the day. If I could change myself and so did everyone will the world be a better place to live in and this is the peace the ghost was talking about.
