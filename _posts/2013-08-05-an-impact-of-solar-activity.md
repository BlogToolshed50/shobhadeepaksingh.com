As revealed in various studies, the impact of the solar activity affects the earth in many ways. The recent exposure from the scientist confirms the fact that, the high energy electrons disappear from the earth&#8217;s surface due to the tide of the solar winds. The UCLA researchers have found that, the heightened solar activity impacts the electrons on the earth&#8217;s outer radiation belt which may pave the way for the prediction of space weather. By this study the scientists from UCLA claim to be very closer towards the understanding of the space phenomena and enhanced chance and ability to predict the space climate phenomena.

We observe many powerful solar events when they emit coronal mass as a result of which, parts of magnetized outer layers of sun&#8217;s atmosphere crash in to earth&#8217;s magnetic field. This type of impacts is said to be triggering geomagnetic storms capable of even damaging the electronics of orbiting space craft. The harmful effect of such geomagnetic storm is that, all the electrons trapped in the radiation belt of the earth vanish and come back few hours latter to damage heavily. As such, the solar storms can affect the space climate and bring bad effect on the earth according to the latest studies by the scientists. Despite such findings, there are various other mysteries that are still to be unearthed by the researchers on the solar activity.
