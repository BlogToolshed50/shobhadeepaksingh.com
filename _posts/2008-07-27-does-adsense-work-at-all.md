It has been long since people stopped being crazy about google adsense. There was a time when every other company made huge money when google stepped in its adsense business. Recently the buzz seems to be reducing since there are other income sources to substitute with. I hardly see many people monetizing heavily with adsense. Also there is huge amount of money that is pending with google from people who could never make their first hundred dollars. This way google has already gulped a bulk of advertisers money.
