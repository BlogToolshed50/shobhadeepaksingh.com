Cool and refreshing, these delicious smoothies are not only a great energizer on a hot summer day, they&#8217;re great for your skin too. Made with antioxidant-rich California peaches, plums and nectarines, these drinks will help your skin ward off the damaging effects of the sun&#8217;s ultraviolet rays. Instead of a soda or a milk shake, try one of these delicious drinks and enjoy the healthful benefits.

Mix ingredients in a blender and whirl until smooth, taking care to stop the machine and scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula to ensure proper blending. Serve immediately or store refrigerated until ready to serve. For best results, serve within one day. (Note: Fresh fruit may be previously frozen. A good trick is to puree fruit and freeze in ice cube trays for later use.) Recipes yield approximately two one-cup servings.
