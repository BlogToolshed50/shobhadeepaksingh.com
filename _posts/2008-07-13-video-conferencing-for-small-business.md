With the increase in gas prices, small companies are facing great problems in communicating with clients. A single tour to meet clients in person can eat up a huge part of the companies resources. This issue can be handled by performing regular meetings with clients through hosted web and video conferencing. There exist few web conferencing services that many big companies already use, but WiredRed.com has better solutions that can suit smaller companies as well. WiredRed.com has been providing real time communication services since 1998 and are leaders in helping in multiparty video conferencing, web conferencing and secure IM software.

WiredRed provides web conferencing services at a very nominal cost as low as $3000/yr, this plan provides up to 5 concurrent users with unlimited usage. This facility will perfectly suit a small business owner who would like to conduct online meetings with his client counterparts. On their website you can download the web conferencing software trial for free and get a feel of their service. I am sure that using such facilities can really bring down the gas and travel cost of a small business company and still provide better connectivity with the clients. They have a great customer supper and also an active forum to discuss your issues regarding the service.
