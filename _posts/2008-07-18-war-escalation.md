In the present context of increasing impatience even among various countries escalation is observed in the matter of war. As observed now Iran and Isreal are at loggerheads which may result in a possible war. Many countries are indirectly get affected due to such unrest in a region.Say for example the fuel supply route is under threat if the war between Iran and Isreal is to start. It is time for the world leaders to ponder over the plight of ordinary citizens who are
  
much affected during war time both economically and from the security angle.
