Vermi-compost is a natural manure that is produced with the help of the earth worms. Earth worms are available in abundance in the soil and they are fed with soil and bio mass like hey to get the vermi-compost. Pits are made in a scientific way and the requisite atmosphere is created for the earth worms to multiply. They eat the soil and bio wastes and convert them in to pellets like materials which are sent out of their system as stool. In fact, we should preserve this earth worms without killing them by applying various injurious insecticides.
