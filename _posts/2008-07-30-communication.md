It is really interesting to see the world improve in its communication skills over the years. it is really great that the cost of communication has really gone down. The cost of mobile phones hasÂ  been steadily decreasing each year and this clearly says how the trend in communication has gone. There are more than a million subscribers in the country with each cell phone company which is a clear indication of the magnitude of the business. For all the development that i happening around the world, more and more communication facilities will be introduced and the cost of communicating with the other person will reduce each day.
