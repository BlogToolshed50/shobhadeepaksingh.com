People are more likely than others to feel it is very important to protect their skin from the sun&#8217;s rays and as a result are more devoted to their sun safety practices. Eighty-one per cent of respondents aged 65 and older feel it is very important to protect their skin from they sun&#8217;s rays, compared to 61 per cent of respondents aged 18-24. Additionally, older Canadians are more likely to wear a wide brimmed hat usually or every time they go outdoors &#8211; 55 per cent of those 55 and older, compared to 36 per cent of respondents aged 18-24.

&#8220;Sun safety is important at every age and you don&#8217;t need to be &#8216;sunbathing&#8217; to be affected by the sun&#8217;s rays,&#8221; says Dr. Linzon. &#8220;It is particularly important for young Canadians to protect themselves from the sun, as melanoma &#8211; one of three types of skin cancer &#8211; is the fourth most common cancer among those aged 15-34, and can be lethal if not detected and treated early. In addition, young people especially don&#8217;t seem to realize that wrinkles and signs of premature aging result from the sun, and that a baseball cap doesn&#8217;t give your face the protection it needs. Children, teens and young adults need adequate sun protection such as using sunscreen, protective clothing and wide brimmed hats.&#8221; 

Listen to your mother; practice sun safety like your dad!

Women are more likely than men to feel protecting their skin from the sun&#8217;s rays is very important (80 per cent versus 65 per cent respectively). However, women are not practicing sun safety to the same extent as men.

Fifty-one per cent of men report they wear a wide brimmed hat usually or every time they go outdoors, compared to 45 per cent of women.

&#8220;Although women are aware of the conditions caused by sun exposure, particularly wrinkles and premature aging, and are aware of the importance of protecting one&#8217;s skin, they are not as diligent about sun protection for themselves,&#8221; says Dr. Linzon. &#8220;Regardless of their excuse, whether it be convenience, time or fashion, women need to make sun safety part of a daily health regimen.&#8221;
