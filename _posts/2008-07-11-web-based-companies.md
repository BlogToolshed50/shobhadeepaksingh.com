Whether you are a web based company or not, today&#8217;s business model requires you to use internet as a marketing tool. It is interesting to see the trends of internet marketing since 1999 . The world was not deterred by the Y2K and has almost been forgotten now. During this period there has been an immense increase in the number of people using internet as a medium to expand their business. I would say the, today if you wanted to start a company, the first thing you might end up doing is searching for a domain name and then name your company by the same name and build over it. In the years to come, I&#8217;m sure that we will be seeing further growth in this trend.
