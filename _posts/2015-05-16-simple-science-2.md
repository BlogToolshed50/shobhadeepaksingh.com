Help children develop a love for science, or nurture their already-growing interest, with these simple experiments.

Cloud Maker

Ever wanted to catch a cloud in a bottle? Now&#8217;s your chance! Pour just a splash of water into a 2-liter plastic bottle. Light a match (a grownup&#8217;s job) and drop it into the bottle. Immediately replace the lid and squeeze the bottle a few times to watch your cloud form.

Magic Flowers

Create your own unique flowers with this neat trick. Fill a vase with water and 8-10 drops of food coloring. Cut the stem of a white carnation at a diagonal, and place the flower into the vase. After a few hours you will notice a slight change of color in the petals. Let the flower soak overnight and observe the dramatic change in the morning. 

Mouth Lightning

Don&#8217;t worry&#8211;this doesn&#8217;t hurt a bit! In fact, you may want to try this at your next sleepover party. Stand in front of a mirror and turn off all of the lights. Pop a wintergreen- flavored Life Saver into your mouth and chew.
