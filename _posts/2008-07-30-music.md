Music is really awesome. It has so many healing powers. In fact there are so many researches that are going around in the world to prove the music has really having those healing powers. I really like hearing to cool music but have always failed to learn how to do that. I want to myself learn some really good music and play it myself. I really attempted just once to learn music with the help of a private teacher but soon realized that I actually wanted to learn guitar and what I was learning was singing!! Oh my god.. I stopped doing it. Finally things are really fine these days and I am still awaiting my first genuine music class.
