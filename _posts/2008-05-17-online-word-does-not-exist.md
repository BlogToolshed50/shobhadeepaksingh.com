  Now this is crazy, image that someone pays you money for buying great paintings of some person say davinci. You have been trading his pictures for almost 20 years now. Your trading are helped by a co worker who just sells what ever painting you give to him. 20 years pass by and one day you happened to talk to your employee about the painting that he sold and that made him a million dollar and yourself a millions more. And you go ahead saying “The painting of davinci&#8230;.” and he goes about asking “who is davinci” . Is that not really stupid. This is the way these spell checkers work. Internet has provided people with zillions of money and they still don&#8217;t recognize the word “online” . How stupid of them.
