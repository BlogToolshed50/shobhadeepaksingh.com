Cloud Maker

Ever wanted to catch a cloud in a bottle? Now&#8217;s your chance! Pour just a splash of water into a 2-liter plastic bottle. Light a match (a grownup&#8217;s job) and drop it into the bottle. Immediately replace the lid and squeeze the bottle a few times to watch your cloud form. 

Magic Flowers

After a few hours you will notice a slight change of color in the petals. Let the flower soak overnight and observe the dramatic change in the morning.
