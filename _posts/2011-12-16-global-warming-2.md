Global warming has become a threat to the human race. Increasing carbon emission from the industries, depletion in the ozone level in the atmosphere, coupled with the smoke emanated from the vehicles too added to the problem. It is observed that the glaciers started melting resulting in the rise of sea level and the water coming into the in-lands where the human habitat is at risk.

Global warming has reduced the monsoon rains leading to the dearth of water for irrigation of the agricultural crops. Now many islands and low level coastal areas have become a threat due to the global warming. Hence, it is our duty to do such activities that will reduce the global warming.
