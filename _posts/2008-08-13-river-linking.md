River linking is a major aspect that is discussed in every nation where  
the water source has become critical.Water derived during rainy season  
is drained in to the sea in a major quantum with out any use from  
the down flowing rivers.If such rivers are linked with each other  
the wastage of water can be prevented and also out in to best use both  
for irrigation and industrial use. Added to that the ill effects of such  
flood is also thwarted.Though the investment is on the higher  
side in the initial stage the benefit that is to be reaped is enormous  
at a latter date.
