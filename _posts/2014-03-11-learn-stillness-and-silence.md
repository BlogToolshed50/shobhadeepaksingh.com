Silence is a very powerful and useful exercise particularly in modern life. Through silence we enter into contact with our greater self. Our greater self knows no limitations, is pure in essence and the more we enter that world the more tranquillity we will begin to experience in our lives. We set ourselves from the ordinary and acknowledge the existence of something greater.

To acquire stillness you simply exercise overall self-control in all areas of your life. With experience, you will find that slipping into silence just comes naturally. You don’t need to force going into silence or be anxious about it. Simply relax and let go. Pay attention to your breathing and breathe gently and while doing this quietly acknowledge the presence of a greater force. Feel peace, feel harmony and enter a state of calm. It is recommended to put aside at least half an hour each day to go into silence. However, you may still practise silence even at work, or on a bus or even whilst in a queue. Just teach yourself to use those spare moments in the day, whether 2 minutes or even a minute. Within that time, just enter an attitude of peace, acknowledge the existence of God, and appreciate all that is around you. For a moment just stop and be quiet.

Set yourself free from the modern norm of rushing and impatience. Just choose to relax, to enjoy things like waiting at a traffic light and use these little gaps to enter silence. Instead of being constantly on the rush, relax and know that all will be fine. The benefits of this are enormous; you will no longer be so stressed out by the queues or the traffic. Even though if you are running late, there is no amount of stressing or swearing which will make it better. Adopt an attitude of stillness always.

Just doing this, is an empowering exercise which teaches our minds that there is a Higher Power, so when a problem confronts us we don’t stress; simply because we are aware of a greater power. Automatically, we will switch to our inner self for all the solutions. By regularly switching into silence we gradually gain poise, such that outward events will not determine our behaviour or our feelings. We will turn to the Great Within for all our needs. There is great wisdom in this statement from the Bible, ‘Be still and know that I am God’.
