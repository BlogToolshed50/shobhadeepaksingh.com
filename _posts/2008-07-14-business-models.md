The most ancient ones of business models were the bait and hook business models. This method provides a product for cheap and that refers to bait. After the purchase of product you can retrieve bulk of the amount by charging it for the service. This is very well employed by the mobile phone companies. There are other business models which were popular in each decades. With the Dotcom companies the business models are slowly weakening and each company comes up with its own business model.
