There been so much theory behind sales and making the company more profitable. It is really important that we chose to make a strategic plan rather than just trying to sell things when opportunity just knocks on our door. It will be awesome to have a look at one good example. There were two car salesmen, bob and ben. Bob was asked by his client about how good the car is, the husband said he likes faster cars and so he went ahead explaining how fast the cars were. Ben saw their kid with them and explained how much safer the car is for kids and guess who made the sale that day. Well selling is an art and one will learn it progressively.
