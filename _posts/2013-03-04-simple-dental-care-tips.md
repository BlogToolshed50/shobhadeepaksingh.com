Maintain a hale and hearty smile with a few simple dental hygiene habits. One should not take smile for granted. Maintain a healthy mouth by regularly practicing good dental hygiene habits and treatment problems.

Routine dental care

Clean your teeth on a daily basis and visit your dentist one or two times a year to avoid gum disease and other dental problems.

To clean your teeth correctly, brush them at least twice a day — plus preferably after each snack and lunch— and do floss daily. Also follow these flowing tips:

• You need to use a soft-bristled brush as it&#8217;s gentler on the gums.
  
• Place the brush at an approach against your teeth, and use short back-and-forth movements to clean the teeth properly. Also clean the inside and chewing base of the teeth and your tongue.
  
• You should replace your brush in every two months.
  
• When you floss, softly ease the floss among your teeth. Then pull the ends of the floss alongside the front and back base of a tooth so that the floss types a &#8220;C&#8221; as it wraps around the tooth. Gently pull the floss from the gum line to the peak of the tooth to scratch off plaque. Remember to floss at the backs of your teeth and to interpret fresh floss among your fingers as you growth through your teeth.

Report problems

In addition to normal care and with dental appointments, call your dentist if you expand any of the following signs and the symptoms of gum disease:

• Red, tender, and if you have swollen gums
  
• Gums the bleed when you clean them, even if they&#8217;re not sore
