Gone are the days when people would think of only windows as the sole means of running an
  
operating system. Recently the awareness about using the newly built OS like the Linux is increasing.
  
Linux servers provide great protection against the windows counterpart. The Mac OS is mostly
  
considered artistically superior to all the others, but people are still hesitant to widely adopt Mac OS
  
due to its non compatibility with the PC softwares. This war will go on for decades to come. The
  
underlying fact in the OS business is that, there can be a new guy always displacing you with new
  
features. All we can do is to sit and watch the war !!.
