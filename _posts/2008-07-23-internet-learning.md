With the advent of internet, people are really getting the opportunity to learn things easily. Various things are directly accessible online . This reduces the cost of learning and also the accessibility is so high. Most ebooks these days are available for free online or for a small amount of money. It is really great how media has improved over the years and made information available to the greater population easily. I think that, in the years to come government themselves need to make internet free for homes so that people can access information more easily and educate themselves better.
