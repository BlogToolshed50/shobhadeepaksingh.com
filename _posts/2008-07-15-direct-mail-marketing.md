Marketing online is a great task that many people undertake. Unlike the online based mail marketing that is fairly simple to send to a million people, doing a surface mail campaign is not all that easy. There are so many people who spend all their time printing those in local stores like Kinko&#8217;s and places and pack it up and mail them. It is not worth the time spent . Since time is money, its bets to outsource those things to local mail brokers who can send those things to your clients.
