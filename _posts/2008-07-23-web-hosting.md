I remember very well in the early 90s how, hosting a website was a great deal. Being a web master was considered something out of the world and to be possessing extraordinary talent. Things have changed rapidly and the server prices and the number of users have increased gradually to provide a whole new perspective to maintain a website. There are numerous free hosting and free blogging platforms that really makes web mastering an easy affair to numerous people around the world. I think that this trend is just going to get better as the days go by.
