One who speaks a lie hurts. Only truth gives life and peace. A lie always hurts. Even the smallest lie hurts. It hurts one to whom the lie has been spoken, and surely hurts the person who speaks the lie.

Unfortunately, in today&#8217;s world lies are taken as way of life. Those who speak lies, bury morality so deep down somewhere, that no one can find it. These people with black hearts speak lies and sometimes they lie to the extent that it kills one who believes them. Speaking a lie is betraying trust. To speak a falsehood to one who believes that truth is being spoken, is sinful. Society may not punish liars, but there is the law of karma, that punishes the liar.

What of the pain that a liar gives to one who trusted her/him? Let us look at that pain in depth. Lies come in many types. Let us first try to find out about what kinds of liars are there on this earth. The first type is a small liar. A poor person, who speaks lies to survive in this brutal world. On the other end, we have liars who rule the nations. For their own power, they invent all kinds of lies and mislead people to believe the untruth. The worst liars are those who lie to someone who has total trust in her/him. A child always takes the word of mother or father as the truth. The child has total trust in the words and takes them as the gospel truth. But as the child grows up, he/she realizes that his/her parent speak lies whenever they find it convenient. The child gets trained at this stage of life. Though the child learns about speaking truth in the text books, what he/she finds in the reality of role models, is different. And that reality is followed. This habit of speaking lies perpetuates in this fashion.

One more type of liar is the lover. Love depends on trust and nothing but total trust. When a lover speaks lies, that not only breaks the trust, but it also kills the hearts. It kills the man/woman to whom the lie is spoken. These lovers are smooth liars. They think that by speaking lies they will save the love, but they manage to destroy not only the love, but also their beloved. They poison the life of their beloved with lies and are nothing short of murderers and killers. As I said before, society may not punish such liars, because society is not concerned with the depth of such relationships. But what of Karma, as the Indian philosophy calls it? That leaves no one. Only the law of karma gives the punishment to such a liar. What about the suffering party? Who will save the person who trusted the liar? Only the mercy of God can save such a battered person.
